<p><span class="date">January 8, 1979</span><br><br><em>Dear Mr. Jack,</em></p>


<p><em>I hope this note finds you well. My name is Amanda, and I am new to the building. I moved in just three days ago, and I am writing to you because something unusual has been happening.</em></p>


<p><em>Since I arrived, I cannot stop hearing noises coming from your house. Most of them seem to come from your son’s room. At first, I thought it might be ordinary children’s play, but the sounds are so loud and clear that it is impossible to ignore.</em></p>


<p><em>What worries me the most is that I can hear voices — and not just any voices. I distinctly hear someone calling the name “Samuel,” and another voice responding, “Jack.” They speak so loudly and clearly that it is impossible to mistake their words. It sounds as if both of them are talking right in the hallway outside my door, yet the only source seems to be your house.</em></p>


<p><em>I don’t mean to intrude or cause concern, but as a new neighbor, I felt it was important to let you know. Please, if there is any explanation, I would be grateful to hear it.</em></p>


<p><em>Yours sincerely,<br>Amanda</em></p>
